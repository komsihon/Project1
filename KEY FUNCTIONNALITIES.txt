Server setup:
    Change ownership of /var/www/ and give it to www-data
    to make sure ikwen can write logs in there.

Deployment of a service and access control:

    When deploying a Service on the Ikwen platform, the person deploying must be set as superuser in his database
    as well as IAO. His collaborates_on field must be properly set.


Deployment of ikwen itself.
    InvoicingConfig must be create in the database.
    settings.DEBUG must be set to False in ikwen settings


Permissions
    Custom created permissions in an ikwen app must start with the prefix "ik_". This prefix differentiates from
    default created permissions. Only permissions with codename starting with "ik_" will show up in collaborators
    management panel.
    Following permissions must absolutely exist:
        accesscontrol.ik_manage_customers:  Collaborator granted this permission can manage customers.


Deployment of BILLING app.
    - Only one billing app may be deployed per domain, to avoid confusion in InvoicingConfig. The same way
    only one InvoicingConfig is allowed per billing deployment. Others will be ignored
    - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE must be properly set in ikwen.billing.crons
    - One may define the following settings:
        * BILLING_BEFORE_NEW_INVOICE = 'path.to.callable'
            callable must have the following signature: callable(subscription).
            subscription is an instance of model defined by BILLING_SUBSCRIPTION_MODEL

        * BILLING_AFTER_NEW_INVOICE = 'path.to.callable'
            callable must have the following signature: callable(invoice)
    - Invoice payments should not exceed 24 months because the calculation
      of duration in days risks truncation above 24 months. See ikwen.billing.utils.get_days_count

Deployment scripts.
    404.html and 500.html located in core/templates must be copied to the root templates folder to override
    django defaults one.
    Same thing for django admin templates located in core/templates/admin. They must be copied to the root
    templates of the project

Collaborators.
    This version limits the number of collaborators to 50. Mainly because it takes away the need to care
    about page navigation in collaborators admin page that is tabbed. Page navigation with tabs would cause
    the need to inject the current tab when querying the datasource and replacing page navigation counters.
    That is simply useless for a platform that is mainly aimed at small and medium size companies.


DJANGO HACKS
    add **kwargs in django.views.generic.list.BaseListView.get_context_data()
    django/forms/models line 201:
        REPLACE
            formfield = f.formfield(**kwargs)
        BY
            try:
                formfield = f.formfield(**kwargs)
            except:
                continue


PERMISSION_BACKEND_NONREL HACKS
    permission_backend_nonrel.models.UserPermissionList:
    1 - REPLACE
            user = models.ForeignKey(User)
        BY
            user = models.ForeignKey(getattr(settings, 'AUTH_USER_MODEL'))

    2 - ADD THIS METHOD
            def to_dict(self):
                return self.user.to_dict()


DJANGO_TRACKING HACKS
    1 - GEO_IP stuffs must be imported this way:

        from django.contrib.gis.geoip import HAS_GEOIP
        if HAS_GEOIP:
            from django.contrib.gis.geoip import GeoIP, GeoIPException

    2 - Replace django User import by this:

        from ikwen.accesscontrol.models import Member as User


DJANGO_CURRENCIES HACKS
    1 - Create some currencies

    2 - Add field precision in currencies.models and define as such :
        precision = models.IntegerField(_('precision'), default=2,
            help_text=_('Number of decimal places for this currency.'))

    3 - currencies.context_processors.py
        Replace de default currency lookup with the following
        try:
            currency = Currency.active.get(code__iexact=request.session[SESSION_KEY])
        except Currency.DoesNotExist:
            try:
                currency = Currency.active.all()[0]
                request.session[SESSION_KEY] = currency.code
            except:
                currency = None

        from ikwen.accesscontrol.models import Member as User
